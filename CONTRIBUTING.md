   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Duplicate_File_Remover.git
   cd Duplicate_File_Remover
   ```

2. Compile the project:

## Coding Standards

### Java Style

- Follow the `.editorconfig` settings in the project
- Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs)
- **Maximum line length**: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add JavaDoc comments for public methods and classes

### Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one clear purpose
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow object-oriented design principles
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception handling
- **Logging**: Use SLF4J for logging, not System.out

### Code Example

```java
/**
 * Calculates the SHA-256 hash of a file.
 * 
 * @param file the file to hash
 * @return the hex-encoded hash string
 * @throws IOException if file cannot be read
 */
public String calculateFileHash(File file) throws IOException {
    logger.debug("Calculating hash for: {}", file.getAbsolutePath());
    
    try (InputStream input = new FileInputStream(file)) {
        MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
        int read;
        
        while ((read = input.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            digest.update(buffer, 0, read);
        }
        
        return bytesToHex(digest.digest());
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("SHA-256 algorithm not available", e);
    }
}
```
